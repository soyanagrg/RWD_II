                <p>Hi, I am Soyana Gurung! I am an Informatics major at the University at Albany with a concentration in Software Development. I have experience working with Python, Java, and HTML, and I enjoy both development and data analysis. Recently, I have been diving into web development, drawn to its creativity and interactivity. Beyond academics, I have worked as a Student Assistant and Peer Mentor, gaining experience in customer service, technical support, and documentation. I enjoy coding, problem-solving, and exploring new technologies. My goal is to build interactive applications that enhance user experience and functionality. Welcome to my portfolio! </p>
